Things to be followed while working on task:
- Don't use any AI tools like, ChatGPT, Bard, Bing Chat, Perplexity, etc.
- All the data should be maintained in local storage. (If you want to use firebase instead of the localstorage you can use that.)
- Use Angular's built-in validators to enforce strong password requirements.
- All the routes should be secured and unauthorized users should be thrown to sign in page.
- Use Angular Reactive Forms for all the forms.
- Use Angular's custom directives or components to create reusable UI elements.
- Use agGrid for showing the list of the users and projects.
- Tables should have pagination, filter and sorting feature.
- If needed use the lazy loading modules.
